NVDA has a stronger percentage gain (2.65%) compared to TSLA (1.32%). \n\nGiven that NVDA is showing stronger momentum and represents a larger portion of our portfolio, I should consider whether to rebalance or maintain our current positions.\n\nLet me check if there are any other stocks showing significant movement today that might be worth considering:\n\nLooking at the price data, some notable movers include:\n- ASML: +4.78% (from $983.18 to $1,030.13)\n- KLAC: +3.05% (from $1,025.71 to $1,057.08)\n- AVGO: +3.00% (from $344.13 to $354.47)\n\nHowever, with only $173.31 in cash, I can't afford to buy any of these expensive stocks.\n\nLet me check if I can buy more NVDA or TSLA with my available cash:\n\nFor NVDA at $184.80:\n- I can buy 0 shares (173.31/184.80 = 0.93, so only 0 full shares)\n\nFor TSLA at $434.90:\n- I can't afford even 1 share\n\nGiven these constraints and the positive momentum in both stocks, the best strategy appears to be holding our current positions. Both stocks are performing well today, and we don't have enough cash to meaningfully add to either position.\n\nTherefore, I'll maintain our current holdings of 32 shares of NVDA and 8 shares of TSLA, with $173.31 in cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
