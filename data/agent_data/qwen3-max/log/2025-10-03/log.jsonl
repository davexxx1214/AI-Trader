While both are performing well today, this concentration carries significant risk.\n\nGiven the limited cash position ($358.08) and the current prices of stocks, I can only afford to buy very small quantities of additional positions. Let me check what I could potentially buy:\n\nThe cheapest stocks in our universe appear to be:\n- WBD: $19.378\n- CMCSA: $30.43\n- KDP: $25.70\n\nWith $358.08, I could buy approximately 18 shares of WBD, 11 shares of CMCSA, or 13 shares of KDP.\n\nHowever, before making any changes, I should consider whether diversification is warranted given our current strategy. Since we don't have specific instructions about target allocations or risk parameters, and both current holdings are performing positively today, it may be prudent to maintain our current positions.\n\nLet me verify if there are any compelling reasons to rebalance or add new positions. Without access to current news or specific trading signals, and given the strong performance of both holdings today, I believe the best course of action is to hold our current positions.\n\nTherefore, no trades will be executed today. Our portfolio remains:\n- 31 shares of NVDA\n- 8 shares of TSLA\n- $358.08 in cash\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
