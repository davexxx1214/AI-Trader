Now, let’s summarize each asset’s portfolio weight:\n\nPortfolio Value: $10,058.27\n\nWeights:\n- NVDA: $1,537.80 ≈ 15.3%\n- MSFT: $1,567.01 ≈ 15.6%\n- AAPL: $1,546.83 ≈ 15.4%\n- GOOG: $1,470.36 ≈ 14.6%\n- AMZN: $1,574.97 ≈ 15.7%\n- META: $1,436.55 ≈ 14.3%\n- CASH: $924.76 ≈ 9.2%\n\nEach mega-cap tech holding is close to an even weighting (~15%), with a modest cash buffer (<10%).\n\nConclusion: \nPortfolio is currently well-diversified across top US tech/AI stocks. No urgent rebalancing is required, but the cash holding is below 10%, which is reasonable for an actively invested portfolio. If you have a preference for more sectors, further diversification, or more aggressive deployment of cash, please indicate.\n\nPortfolio has been analyzed and updated.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
