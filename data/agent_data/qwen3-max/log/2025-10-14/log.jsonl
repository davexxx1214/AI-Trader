Let me verify the updated portfolio:\n\n- NVDA: 32 shares × $184.77 = $5,912.64 (62.2% of portfolio)\n- TSLA: 8 shares × $426.79 = $3,414.32 (35.9% of portfolio)  \n- Cash: $173.31 (1.8% of portfolio)\n- Total portfolio value: $9,500.27\n\nThe portfolio remains concentrated but I've taken advantage of the slight dip in NVDA to add to our position. Given the current market conditions and lack of negative fundamental news, maintaining our core positions in these two strong technology companies appears to be a reasonable strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
