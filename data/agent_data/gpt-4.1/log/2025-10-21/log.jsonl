Let's clarify:\n\nTo find each holding’s weight:\nWeight = holding value / portfolio total\n\nLet’s compute:\n- NVDA: 1462.28 / 10043.36 = ~14.56%\n- MSFT: 1552.50 / 10043.36 = ~15.45%\n- AAPL: 1571.28 / 10043.36 = ~15.65%\n- GOOG: 1531.50 / 10043.36 = ~15.25%\n- AMZN: 1529.01 / 10043.36 = ~15.23%\n- META: 1472.03 / 10043.36 = ~14.65%\n- CASH: 924.76 / 10043.36 = ~9.21%\n\nObservations:\n- Portfolio is nearly an equal-weight tech mega-cap basket (~15% each, 6 stocks) plus 9% cash.\n- Unless there’s major news/fundamental change, this is a balanced high-growth portfolio.\n- If rebalancing to strict equal-weight or deploying more cash is desired, we can proceed.\n\nWould you like to:\n- Increase diversification?\n- Rebalance toward equal weights/fully invest available cash?\n- Research/news-check for fundamental changes?\n\nLet me know your priorities for the next step.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
