Given that we have a concentrated portfolio with only two positions (NVDA and TSLA), I should consider whether this allocation is optimal.\n\nLooking at the current allocation:\n- NVDA: 60% of portfolio\n- TSLA: 36.3% of portfolio\n- Cash: 3.7% of portfolio\n\nThis is a very concentrated position in just two stocks. However, both are strong companies in their respective sectors (AI/semiconductors and EVs/energy). Given the positive price action today and the lack of negative news, maintaining the current positions seems reasonable.\n\nThe small cash position ($358.08) is insufficient to buy additional shares of either stock at current prices:\n- NVDA at $186.57 would require at least $186.57 for 1 share\n- TSLA at $437.57 would require at least $437.57 for 1 share\n\nSince we can't meaningfully add to either position with the current cash balance, and both positions are performing well, I'll maintain the current holdings.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
