Looking at our current holdings:\n\n- NVDA: 20 shares (38.3% of portfolio)\n- AAPL: 9 shares (24.5% of portfolio) \n- TSLA: 4 shares (18.6% of portfolio)\n- FANG: 12 shares (18.5% of portfolio)\n- Cash: $11.85 (0.1% of portfolio)\n\nOur portfolio is concentrated in just 4 stocks with very little cash. Given that TSLA is showing a slight decline today while others are up, and considering we have minimal cash reserves, I should evaluate whether to make any adjustments.\n\nHowever, without specific trading signals or strategy parameters provided, and given that all positions except TSLA are showing positive movement today, the prudent approach would be to maintain current positions. The portfolio is performing well overall with a +0.49% gain today.\n\nSince we have only $11.85 in cash, we don't have meaningful buying power to add new positions or increase existing ones significantly. Any trading would require selling existing positions first.\n\nGiven the lack of specific trading instructions and the generally positive performance of our holdings today, I'll maintain the current positions without making any trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
