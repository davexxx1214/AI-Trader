However, all major holdings are showing positive momentum today.\n\nGiven that:\n1. All positions except FANG are up today\n2. FANG is essentially flat (-0.04%)\n3. No negative news is apparent\n4. The portfolio has good diversification across different tech subsectors (semiconductors, consumer tech, social media, EVs, energy)\n\nI believe the current positions are reasonable to maintain. However, I should consider whether to rebalance or make any tactical adjustments.\n\nLooking at the cash position ($244.80), it's quite low at only 2.4% of the portfolio. This limits flexibility for new opportunities. But given that all current holdings are performing well, there's no immediate need to sell positions to raise cash.\n\nLet me check if there are any stocks that might be worth adding with the available cash:\n\nWith $244.80 available, I could potentially buy:\n- 1 share of several lower-priced stocks\n- But most quality tech stocks are priced higher than this amount\n\nGiven the limited cash and the fact that all current positions are performing positively, the optimal strategy today appears to be **holding current positions** without making any trades.\n\nThe portfolio is well-positioned with strong performers across key tech sectors, and there's no compelling reason to make changes based on today's price movements alone.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
