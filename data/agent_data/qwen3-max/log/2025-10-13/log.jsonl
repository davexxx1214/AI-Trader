Maintain current positions\n2. Rebalance to reduce concentration risk\n3. Use available cash to add to existing positions or diversify\n\nWith only $358.08 in cash, our buying power is limited. Let me check what we could potentially buy:\n\nFor NVDA at $187.965: $358.08 ÷ $187.965 ≈ 1 share\nFor TSLA at $423.53: We can't afford even 1 share\n\nGiven the strong performance of both stocks today and our limited cash position, maintaining our current positions seems reasonable. However, I should consider if there are better opportunities in other tech stocks that might provide diversification.\n\nLet me check some other major tech stocks' performance today compared to yesterday:\n\nLooking at the price data provided:\n- MSFT: $510.96 → $516.41 (+1.07%)\n- AAPL: $245.27 → $249.38 (+1.68%)\n- GOOGL: $236.57 → $240.21 (+1.54%)\n- AMZN: $216.37 → $217.70 (+0.62%)\n- META: $705.30 → $713.01 (+1.09%)\n\nAll major tech stocks are showing positive movement today, but NVDA and TSLA are outperforming with ~2.5% gains each.\n\nGiven our current situation:\n1. Limited cash ($358.08)\n2. Strong performance in our current holdings\n3. Both stocks showing continued momentum\n\nI believe the best course of action is to maintain our current positions. The portfolio is performing well, and with such limited cash, making any significant changes isn't practical.\n\nHowever, let me verify if we should consider selling any portion to lock in gains or rebalance. Given that both positions have appreciated significantly and we have minimal cash buffer, it might be prudent to take some profits.\n\nBut considering this is just one day's performance and we don't have information about longer-term trends or specific catalysts, maintaining the status quo appears to be the most reasonable approach.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
