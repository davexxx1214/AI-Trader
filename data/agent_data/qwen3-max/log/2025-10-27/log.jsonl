Given that we have a concentrated portfolio with only 4 stocks and minimal cash ($11.85), I should consider whether any rebalancing is needed.\n\nHowever, looking at the portfolio composition:\n- NVDA: 39.1% of portfolio\n- AAPL: 24.5% of portfolio  \n- TSLA: 18.1% of portfolio\n- FANG: 18.1% of portfolio\n\nThis is a reasonably diversified tech-focused portfolio. Since all positions are performing well and we have very limited cash to make meaningful new purchases, I don't see a compelling reason to make any trades today.\n\nThe portfolio is up 1.31% today, which is solid performance. With only $11.85 in cash, we can't make significant new investments, and selling any of our winning positions would lock in gains but reduce our exposure to these strong performers.\n\nGiven the positive momentum in all our holdings and limited cash available, the optimal strategy today is to maintain our current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
