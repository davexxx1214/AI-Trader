However, without specific news or signals indicating major changes, and given that all positions are showing relatively small price movements (within 0.5%), I should maintain the current positions.\n\nThe cash position is quite low at only $103.29, which limits flexibility for new opportunities. However, since I don't have specific signals to buy other stocks and the current holdings are in major tech companies that tend to be resilient, maintaining the current allocation seems reasonable.\n\nLet me verify if there are any significant price movements in other major tech stocks that might warrant a position change:\n\nLooking at the price data provided, I can see that some other major tech stocks like MSFT, META, and AMZN have slight positive movements, but without a clear strategy or signal to rotate positions, it's better to maintain current holdings.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n1. Current positions are in strong tech companies (NVDA, AAPL, TSLA)\n2. Price movements are minimal (all within 0.5%)\n3. No significant news available to drive trading decisions\n4. Portfolio is concentrated but in quality names\n\nI conclude that no trading actions are necessary today. The portfolio should remain as is.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
