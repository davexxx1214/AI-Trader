The overall portfolio gained 1.44%, which is positive.\n\nGiven that we have very little cash ($11.85) and our portfolio is already well-positioned with strong performers like NVDA, and considering that all our current holdings are showing reasonable performance (except FANG which had a minor decline), I don't see an immediate need for major rebalancing.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any opportunities to optimize our position given the current market conditions. Since FANG is the only stock showing a decline and represents about 16.7% of our portfolio, I should consider whether this presents a buying opportunity or if we should reduce exposure.\n\nBut without specific news about FANG's fundamentals or the energy sector, and given that the decline is minimal (-0.32%), it's likely just normal market fluctuation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nMaintain current positions. The portfolio is performing well with a positive daily return, and we don't have sufficient cash to make meaningful new purchases without selling existing positions. The current allocation, while concentrated in NVDA, is benefiting from NVDA's strong performance.\n\nSince no trading actions are necessary based on this analysis, I'll conclude the position update.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
