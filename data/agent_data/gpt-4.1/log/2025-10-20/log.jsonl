Let's clarify calculation of portfolio weights:\n\nWeight for each = (position value ÷ total portfolio value) × 100\n\n- NVDA: (1465.04 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 14.74%\n- MSFT: (1543.83 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 15.53%\n- AAPL: (1535.31 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 15.45%\n- GOOG: (1531.38 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 15.41%\n- AMZN: (1497.16 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 15.06%\n- META: (1442.38 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 14.51%\n- CASH: (924.76 / 9939.86) × 100 ≈ 9.31%\n\nInterpretation:\n- The portfolio is well-balanced, with each major tech holding around 14.5-15.5%.\n- Cash is just under 10%.\n\nNo position is excessive or underweight based on diversification standards; all are in the 14-16% range, and cash is reasonable.\n\nPortfolio analysis and daily update is complete. No action (buy/sell) is required unless you want to rebalance further or shift allocation.\n\nPortfolio composition is up-to-date as of 2025-10-20.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
