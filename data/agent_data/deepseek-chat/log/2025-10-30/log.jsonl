Let me check if I can buy any very cheap stocks. Looking at the price list, the cheapest stocks I could potentially buy are:\n- KHC: $24.32\n- KDP: $27.32\n- CMCSA: $26.09\n\nBut I don't have positions in these and they're not in my portfolio strategy. Let me keep the cash for now.\n\n## Summary of Portfolio Update\n\nI have successfully updated the portfolio for today (2025-10-30):\n\n### Transactions Made:\n1. **Sold 1 share of GOOG** at $291.72 (taking profits on strong +6.01% gain)\n2. **Sold 1 share of AMD** at $259.92 (reducing position that was down -1.67%)\n3. **Sold 1 share of CSCO** at $71.37 (raising additional cash)\n4. **Bought 1 share of META** at $669.15 (taking advantage of significant -10.98% drop)\n\n### Current Portfolio Value:\n- **Total Stock Value**: ~$10,878.37\n- **Cash**: $13.51\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: ~$10,891.88\n\n### Key Portfolio Changes:\n- Increased META position from 1 to 2 shares (opportunistic buy on dip)\n- Reduced GOOG, AMD, and CSCO positions to fund the META purchase\n- Maintained core positions in NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, etc.\n\nThe portfolio is now positioned to benefit from META's recovery potential while maintaining exposure to other quality tech stocks. The cash position is minimal, indicating nearly full investment allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
