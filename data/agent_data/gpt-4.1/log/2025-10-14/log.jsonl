If you want to book profits, trim one or more top-weighted names.\n- For further optimization, I can perform a quick fundamental check on any position or suggest ideas based on market/fundamental updates.\n\nWould you like a recommendation for rotation or an in-depth analysis on a particular holding?\n\n(Position calculation and portfolio update is complete.)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
