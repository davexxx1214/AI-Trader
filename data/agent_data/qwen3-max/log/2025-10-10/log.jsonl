Hold our current positions\n2. Sell a small portion of one position to diversify\n3. Use our available cash to add a new position\n\nWith only $358.08 in cash, I can't buy many shares of expensive stocks like MSFT ($519.64), GOOGL ($241.43), or META ($730.92). However, I could potentially buy:\n- 1 share of GOOGL ($241.43) with cash remaining\n- 1 share of AAPL ($254.94) with cash remaining\n\nLet me check if there are any more affordable quality stocks in our universe:\n\nLooking at the price list, some more affordable options include:\n- INTC: $38.46\n- WBD: $17.72\n- TTD: $54.19\n- CMCSA: $30.19\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about adding lower-quality or highly speculative stocks just because they're affordable.\n\nGiven the constraints and the fact that both NVDA and TSLA are showing positive momentum today, I believe the best course of action is to maintain our current positions. Our portfolio is concentrated but in two strong companies that are both up today.\n\nThe limited cash position ($358.08) isn't sufficient to meaningfully diversify into high-quality large-cap stocks without selling existing positions. Since both positions are performing well, I don't see a compelling reason to sell either position today.\n\nTherefore, I'll maintain our current holdings:\n- Keep 31 shares of NVDA\n- Keep 8 shares of TSLA  \n- Keep $358.08 in cash\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
