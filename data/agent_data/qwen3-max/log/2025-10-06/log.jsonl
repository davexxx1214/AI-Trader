This creates significant concentration risk.\n\nLooking at today's price movements:\n- NVDA is down 1.13%\n- TSLA is up 2.54%\n\nGiven the high concentration in these two stocks and limited cash position, I should consider whether any rebalancing is appropriate. However, without specific trading signals or strategy guidelines, and with only a small cash position, major changes might not be warranted.\n\nLet me check if there are any significant price movements in other potential stocks that might present opportunities:\n\nLooking at the price data provided, I notice some notable movements:\n- AMD has a significant price increase from $164.67 to $226.445 (+37.5%)\n- APP (AppLovin) is up from $682.76 to $684.475 (+0.25%)\n- MU (Micron) is up from $187.83 to $195.01 (+3.82%)\n- SHOP (Shopify) is up from $161.14 to $166.55 (+3.36%)\n\nAMD's massive price jump seems unusual and might warrant investigation, but without more information, it's difficult to determine if this is sustainable.\n\nGiven our current positions and the lack of a specific trading strategy directive, I'll maintain our current positions. The portfolio has a reasonable split between NVDA and TSLA, with TSLA showing positive momentum today while NVDA is slightly down.\n\nSince we have limited cash ($358.08), we can't make significant new purchases even if we wanted to. The most prudent action is to hold our current positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
