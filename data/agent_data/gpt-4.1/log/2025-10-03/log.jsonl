If you have a specific fundamental event or news story to incorporate, please provide details.\n\nYour updated portfolio as of today:\n- NVDA: 8 shares\n- MSFT: 3 shares\n- AAPL: 6 shares\n- GOOG: 6 shares\n- AMZN: 7 shares\n- META: 2 shares\n- CASH: $924.76\n\nLet me know if you'd like to attempt another data query, adjust allocations, or focus on specific signals.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
