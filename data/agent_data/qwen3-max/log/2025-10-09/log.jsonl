However, I need to be cautious about transaction costs and maintain diversification.\n\nLooking at the current allocation, NVDA represents a very large portion (61%) of the portfolio, which creates concentration risk. While NVDA is performing well, it might be prudent to take some profits or at least not add more to this position.\n\nTSLA's decline might present a buying opportunity if I believe in the long-term fundamentals, but given the current downward trend, it might be better to wait for stabilization.\n\nGiven the limited cash position ($358.08) and the high share prices of most stocks in our universe, I have limited ability to make significant new purchases. Let me check if there are any stocks that could be purchased with the available cash:\n\nThe cheapest stocks in our universe based on today's prices:\n- WBD: $17.84\n- TTD: $54.08  \n- ON: $50.88\n- DXCM: $67.56\n\nHowever, given our current strategy focus on quality large-cap tech stocks and the limited cash available, making small purchases in low-priced stocks may not be optimal.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the current market conditions and portfolio composition, I believe the best course of action is to maintain current positions. NVDA is performing well and represents a strong AI/semiconductor play. TSLA, while down today, is still a major position in electric vehicles and energy. The cash position is relatively small and not sufficient to meaningfully diversify into new positions without creating very small, inefficient allocations.\n\nI will monitor the positions and look for better entry points or rebalancing opportunities in the coming days.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
