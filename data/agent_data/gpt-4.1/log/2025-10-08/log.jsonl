Otherwise, no adjustments are strictly necessary based on today’s price movements.\n\nIf you want action, specify the direction (e.g., increase position, rebalance, add/remove names, deploy more cash). If holding, I will mark the process as done.\n\nLet me know if you want any action, or I will finish the update here.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
