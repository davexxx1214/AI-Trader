Here's what was accomplished:\n\n**Trades Executed:**\n1. **Sold 1 share of PEP** - Reduced exposure to the underperforming consumer staples sector\n2. **Bought 4 shares of FAST** - Increased position in this industrial stock showing positive momentum\n\n**Portfolio Changes:**\n- **PEP**: Reduced from 2 to 1 shares (cut exposure to declining stock)\n- **FAST**: Increased from 4 to 8 shares (doubled position in rising stock)\n- **Cash**: Now $14.50 (insufficient for additional trades)\n\n**Portfolio Strategy Rationale:**\n- The portfolio remains well-diversified across technology, industrial, and transportation sectors\n- Increased exposure to FAST which showed positive momentum today (+0.3%)\n- Reduced exposure to PEP which declined today (-0.4%)\n- Maintained positions in strong performers like NVDA (+2.0%), AMD (+2.0%), and AVGO (+2.1%)\n\nThe portfolio is now optimized given the available cash constraints, with a focus on maintaining exposure to high-performing technology stocks while reallocating from underperforming positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
