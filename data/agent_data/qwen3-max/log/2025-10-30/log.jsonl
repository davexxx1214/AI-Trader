This could be another opportunity, but I should be cautious about adding too many positions.\n\nGiven our limited cash and the fact that we've already added META as a new position, I think it's prudent to maintain our current cash position for now rather than making additional small purchases that would further fragment our portfolio.\n\nLet me summarize the actions taken today:\n1. Sold 2 shares of TSLA at $451.05 each, generating $902.10 in cash\n2. Bought 1 share of META at $669.15, taking advantage of its significant price drop (-11%)\n3. Maintained positions in NVDA, AAPL, FANG, and reduced TSLA position\n\nThis rebalancing has:\n- Reduced exposure to TSLA which was showing weakness\n- Added exposure to META at a significantly discounted price\n- Maintained our core tech holdings (NVDA, AAPL, FANG)\n- Kept a small cash reserve for future opportunities\n\nOur updated portfolio now has better diversification across major tech companies while taking advantage of a market dip in META.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
